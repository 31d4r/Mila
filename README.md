## What is Mila?

Mila is your intelligent meeting companion for Mac. It records audio from your system, transcribes it with AI, and helps you never miss what matters in your meetings, calls, and conversations.

Think of Mila as your personal audio assistant that works invisibly in the background. It captures audio from any app on your Mac - Zoom, Teams, Slack, Google Meet, or anything else playing on your system. Then it uses AI to transcribe everything locally on your device, so your recordings stay private and secure.

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up**: Create a free account on the Mila website
2. **Get Your License Token**: After signing up, you get a license token from your dashboard
3. **Activate in Mila**: Paste the token into the Mila macOS app
4. **Start Recording**: Mila activates and you can start recording immediately
5. **Manage Your Subscription**: Upgrade, downgrade, or manage devices through your dashboard anytime

### License Seats

Each license seat equals one Mac device. If you have a 2-seat plan, you can activate Mila on 2 different Macs. Each device stores its recordings locally - they don't sync between devices for privacy.

Once activated, Mila works offline. The app checks in with the server periodically when you're online to keep everything up to date.

## Privacy and Security

Mila is built with privacy as a core principle:

- Recordings stay on your Mac by default
- Transcription happens on your device using local AI
- No audio is sent to external servers unless you explicitly choose cloud features
- All data can be deleted at any time
- We never share or sell your data

Your account and payments are protected with industry-standard security measures to keep your information safe.
